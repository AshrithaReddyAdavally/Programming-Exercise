**1. Does the solution work for larger graphs?**\
   Yes, it should work for bigger graphs. It finds the longest path in a type of graph called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). As long as the graph doesn't have loops (like going from A to B and then back to A), this method should handle larger graphs fine.\
**2. Can you think of any optimizations?**\
   One idea is to remember previously calculated results as we go through the graph. This way, if we encounter the same situation again, we can just use the previously calculated result instead of recalculating, which can save time.\
**3. Whatâ€™s the computational complexity of your solution?**\
   It's not too complicated! The time it takes depends on the number of vertices (points) and edges (connections) in the graph. So, if there are V vertices and E edges, the time it takes is proportional to V + E. That's not too bad!\
**4. Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled?**\
   Yes, the solution assumes that the graph doesn't have any loops. If there are loops, like going from A to B and then back to A, the method might not work correctly. So, it's important to make sure the graph is a special type called a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\
